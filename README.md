# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a single-page application (SPA) portfolio for a web developer, built using React. The portfolio showcases the developer's projects, provides information about the developer, and includes a contact form. This portfolio is designed to set the developer apart by utilizing modern React skills and providing a seamless user experience.

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Header, Content Section, and Footer**: Upon loading the portfolio, the user is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
- **Header Navigation**: The header contains the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
- **Navigation Titles**: The navigation includes titles: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
- **Section Navigation**: Clicking on a navigation title presents the corresponding section below the navigation without reloading the page, and the clicked title is highlighted.
- **Default Section**: The About Me title and section are selected by default upon the initial load of the portfolio.
- **About Me Section**: The About Me section includes a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
- **Portfolio Section**: The Portfolio section displays titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Section**: The Contact section includes a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
- **Form Validation**: Moving the cursor out of a form field without entering text triggers a notification that the field is required. Entering text into the email address field triggers a notification if the entered email address is invalid.
- **Resume Section**: The Resume section includes a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
- **Footer**: The footer includes text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (e.g., Stack Overflow, Twitter).
